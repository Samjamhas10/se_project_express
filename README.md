# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End Project 12

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This application is a weather-based clothing recommendation app. The main focus is to build a RESTful API, where users can get, add, delete, update clothing items.

## Project Description

- Designing and building a RESTful API
- Set up validation and Error handling
- Work with NoSQL databases such as MongoDb

The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies && Techniques

- Express.js - Web framework for building APIs
- Node.js - Server-side Javascript
- MongoDB - NoSQL database for data storage
- Mongoose - MongoDB object modeling
- ESLint - For code quality

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
